		<h1>Art Mediums</h1>
        <h2 id="paint">Paint</h2>
        <p>Painting is an art form thta typically uses wet liquids imbued with pigments to create images. This medium is typically used with paintbrushed and canvas as main materials. However, this medium can also be used on paper or sometimes even put into different markers and pencils for conveniecny.</p>

        <p>Acrylic paint is a water-based paint medium. Due to it's water base it dries quickly, but in turn is less opaque than oil paint, yet still more opaque than watercolors. 
        Often is used to paint pieces that require large areas of flat color. Acrylics are also slightly more difficult to mix into a variety of of different colors due to their
        thinner consistency as well. Their consistency plus their quick drying time makes them great for fast drawing and sometimes messy art as it is also easily covered up with white.
        However, these same traits sometimes make this paint medium difficult to blend. This makes smooth gradients between colors a little more difficult as well as other types of shading
        such as skin tones. If one wants to use acrylic paint, it is recommended for either flat color paintings or paintings that are tight on time. OF course, if one wants to create very 
        detailed, highly blended art, this medium is still viable. Just be sure to use plenty of water and toi make sure one's paint doesn't dry out.</p>
      
        <h3 id="oil">Oil</h3>

        <p>Oil paint is an oil-based paint medium. It takes long, long times to dry and is quite thick in consistency. It is the most opaque paint but it can be thinned with differnt
        oils. For example, linseed oil is often used to thin out oil paint or to increase it's blendability. Oil paints also take long times to dry. In fact, some people say that
        an oil painting never truly dries. Typcialy for it to feel dry to the touch, it takes around a week. For it to dry what is considered completely it takes around two weeks.
        this means that oil paint is great for long term projects that require a high amount of blending or shading. For example, most hyperrealistic paintings are done in oil paint
        as the skin tones require a lot of blending and mixing of colors to get right; older renaissance paintings are also done with oil paint as it often brings out the most viid and 
        strong colors. Speaking of colors, oil paints mix wonderfully and because they do not dry out, new colors made last for long periods of time. oil paint can even be left out for 
        several nights and still be functional. For people who want faster drying oil paints, but also the same amount of blendability can use agents such as galkyd. Overall, oil painting
        is good for paintings where one has a long set amount of time to paint and also if one desires to have grand amounts of shading.</p>
       
        <h3 id="watercolor">Watercolor</h3>

        <p>Watercolor is a water based paint medium. It dries very quickly and has the thinnest consistency out of all the paint types listed here. Unlike other paints, 
        watercolor can be dried and reused. Water is necessary to activate watercolors and adding more or less water changes the opactiy of the paint. Watercolors can be 
        used with multiple colors or to create monotone paintings in which shading is done using strategic layering and diluting of only one color. This style of art allows
        for a painting that only has one color but still contains depth and shape. Watercolors are most often used for paintngs that have a soft look and are okay with the 
        images not being in exact shapes. People do sitll use watercolors for highly detailed work and it is possibly the best paint for layered drawings.

        <h2 id="pencil">Pencil</h2>
        <p>Pencil is arguably the most traditional art form. It uses different type of pencils, most traditionally wooden pencils filled with a long line of lead. This medium can have a different variety of pencils however.</p>

        <h3 id="colored">Colored Pencil</h3>
        <img src="/img/stars.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="A man standing in the stars. 2021">
        <p>Colored pencils are quite literally just pencils that have colored lead. This lead is typically made from a combination of grpahite and some form of clay and also can be 
        found in many different forms depending on the brand of colored pencil. For exmaple, prismacolor colored pencils are wax-based pencils while a different brand such as faber 
        castel has oil based colored pencils. These different types of bases changes the way one can blend and mix and match different colored pencils. Colored pencils, as they can 
        be sharpened, blended and layered are often a good choice for very deatiled work, yet still realistic work. This medium can be used even on very small sheets of paper to achieve
        a high amount of detail. Furthermore, colored pencils can come in an incredibly large range of colors and shades making it easier to create smooth blends and gradients between
        colors. However, colored pencils can be on the more expensive side of materials as well as time consuming if one wants to create larger pieces of work. THis is because actually
        coloring with colored pencils takes a grand amount of time and if one wants to make a drawing that has no visible white then this medium may take a long time. Also as colored pencils
        have to be sharpened, they become a fairly finite medium wherer oftentimes certain colors such as white or blakc must be frequently replaced.</p>

        <p>Graphite is the most traditional medium for art as they are incredibly common as well as cheap compared to other pencil-like mediums. </p>
