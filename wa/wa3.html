        <h2>Paint</h2>
        <h3>Acrylic</h3>

        <p>Acrylic paint is a water-based paint medium. Due to it's water base it dries quickly, but in turn is less opaque than oil paint, yet still more opaque than watercolors. 
        Often is used to paint pieces that require large areas of flat color. Acrylics are also slightly more difficult to mix into a variety of of different colors due to their
        thinner consistency as well. Their consistency plus their quick drying time makes them great for fast drawing and sometimes messy art as it is also easily covered up with white.
        However, these same traits sometimes make this paint medium difficult to blend. This makes smooth gradients between colors a little more difficult as well as other types of shading
        such as skin tones. If one wants to use acrylic paint, it is recommended for either flat color paintings or paintings that are tight on time. OF course, if one wants to create very 
        detailed, highly blended art, this medium is still viable. Just be sure to use plenty of water and toi make sure one's paint doesn't dry out.</p>
        <h3>Oil</h3>

        <p>Oil paint is an oil-based paint medium. It takes long, long times to dry and is quite thick in consistency. It is the most opaque paint but it can be thinned with differnt
        oils. For example, linseed oil is often used to thin out oil paint or to increase it's blendability. Oil paints also take long times to dry. In fact, some people say that
        an oil painting never truly dries. Typcialy for it to feel dry to the touch, it takes around a week. For it to dry what is considered completely it takes around two weeks.
        this means that oil paint is great for long term projects that require a high amount of blending or shading. For example, most hyperrealistic paintings are done in oil paint
        as the skin tones require a lot of blending and mixing of colors to get right; older renaissance paintings are also done with oil paint as it often brings out teh most viid and strong colors. Speaking of colors, oil paints mix wonderfully and because they do not dry out, new colors made
        last for long periods of time. oil paint can even be left out for several nights and still be functional. For people who want faster drying oil paints, but also the same amount
        of blendability can use agents such as galkyd. Overall, oil painting is good for paintings where one has a long set amount of time to paint and also if one desires to have grand
        amounts of shading.</p>
        <h3>Watercolor</h3>

        <p>Watercolor is a water based paint medium. It dries very quickly adn has teh thinnest consistency out of all the paint types listed here. Unlike other paints, watercolor can be
        dried and reused. Water is necessary to activate watercolors and adding more or less water changes the opactiy of the paint. Watercolors can be used with multiple colors or to create
        monotone
