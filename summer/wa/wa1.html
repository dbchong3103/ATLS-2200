        <h2><b>Just A Preface</b></h2>
        <h4>Uhm. I'm retaking this class as I had a rough spring semester and was actually really nervous to ask for regrades and extensions (which honestly is probably why I got a C-), but this maymester I'm just hoping to do better in all fairness. I've fixed the technical issues that I had with two computers and I've come to this class with a significantly better mindset than spring semester. Hopefully, this means I gt a significantly better grade in this class, cause in the spring I'd finish the assignment late and then be nervous to ask for an extension beforehand and therefore despite actually doing everything... I didn't get everything graded. But! Through the spring, I have learned that my professor in this class will not hunt me down for being a little slow sometimes and I am obviously more confident in everything because I've already done it once so yay! Thank you for having me and I will do my best this maymester!</h4>
        
        <h2><b>The Actual About Me</b></h2>
        <h4>Hi, my name is Dahn Bi Chong! I'm a 20 year old CTD major who has had a really rough first year at CU Boulder (I transferrred this year). I like dogs, art and design. I'm hoping to work in game design and character/environmetn design in the future. I enjoy games such as League of Legends(Unfortunately), Valorant(another, unfortunately), Minecraft, Pokemon and more! I hope to work in these companies or these fields in the future and bring my design to life! (*Note: Seeing as I've taken this class before I added some random css for fun :D)</h4>
