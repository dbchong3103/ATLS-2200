        <h1><b>Error Breakdown</b></h1>
        <h3>Page 1</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initally, I added a Doctype to the top of the page and set it to HTML.</li>
            <li>Secondly, used the html element right after and added a language to the page.</li>
            <li>Third, I found that the words crème fraiche were supposed to me emphaszed text but there was a type when trying to use the em element.</li>
            <li>Fouth, for the paragaph that begins "Deep into my phone..." the second part of the p element was missing a backslash.</li>
            <li>Fifth, though I'm not sure if this was an error or intentional, I changed the heading sizes of the date, title and author to more accurately represent the source page
                and even turned that portion into its own section so that I could change teh alignment to match the source page.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Page 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I corrected the bolding element on the words New Beehive Inn.</li>
            <li>Further, the headings were all of different sizes so I changed all the main headings to h2, referencing the source page.</li>
            <li>The bloding for the word interior was on teh outside of the heading element instead of within, so I changed that as well.</li>
            <li>Also there were two links that didn’t actually lead anywhere so i used teh source page to find teh correct links and paste them into the page.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I'm not sure if this was necessary, but I added a thematic break or hr element beneath the main titles of description, History and Closure to match the source page.</li>
         </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>Page 3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There was a typo on the list element where there as only and l and no i so I corrected that.</li>
            <li>The last name Zapata was also bolded as a table header or th so I changed that to be th, or part of a row as it should be.</li>
            <li>Finally, many of the names and ages were out of their correct rows and columns so I rearranged the names and ages according to the source page so that every row had one first name, one last and one age.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>Page 4</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>There was no doctype at the beginning of the page so the html doctype was added.</li>
            <li>First, the correct td element, or row element was added after each image element so that the rows and columns would be correct.</li>
            <li>Further, the images were rearranged to match the column headings. Previously, they were grouped into rows and not columns.</li>
            <li>None of the images had attributes for the scenario where they don't load so I added descriptions to each image.</li>
      </ul>
